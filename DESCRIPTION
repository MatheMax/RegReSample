Title: Compute regularized optimal two-stage designs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Maximilian Pilz
Maintainer: Maximilian Pilz <pilz@imbi.uni-heidelberg.de>
Description: RegReSample provides the computation of optimal two-stage designs for normally distributed outcome. 
    The optimality criterion can be defined by the user as a weighted average of different key figures of the design.
    The package supports a Bayesian as well as a frequentist power definition and is therefore flexible to operate with conditional as well as predictive power.
